Usage:
convolution [-f <STRING>] [-a <INT>,<INT>,...[:[<STRING>,<STRING>,...]]] [-b <INT>,<INT>,...[:[<STRING>,<STRING>,...]]] [-h] [-t <INT>] [-i <STRING>]

perform convolution based on provided options.

Options                      Description
  -a,                        columns that we want in the output file without performing convolution.
                             No default value.
  -b,                        columns that we want in the output file with performing convolution.
                             No default value.
  -c,                        If provided the header and comment from the input file will be written
                             without modification to the output file. Header is the first line of the
                             input file.
  -d                         Delimeter to use. Default value is ' '.
  -f                         name of the input file that we want to convolute. No default value.
  -i                         Info to write as comment in the output file
  -o                         name of the output file. If not provided the string '_convoluted.txt' will be
                             appended to the input file.
  -s                         Number of rows to skip from the input file. Default value is 0.
  -t                         to test_process the performance of the convolution program. No default value.
  -h, --help                 display this help and exit
  -v, --version              output version information and exit
  -w                         If provided input b data will be written to the output file.


The INT argument is an integer.
The STRING argument is a string of characters.

A line that begins with '#' is considered a commented line.

Exit status:
 0  if OK,
 1  if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),
 2  if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).
